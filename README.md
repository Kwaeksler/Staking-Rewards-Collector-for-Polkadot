## Description
The Staking-Rewards-Collector creates a report (JSON file) with all staking rewards information for Polkadot. Information is retrieved via the API from Subscan.io. Optionally, prices can be included in the JSON file, which are queried via the API from CoinGecko.com. The goal is to integrate the JSON file into Microsoft Excel. Furthermore, a CSV file can be created to upload the reward information to Cointracking.

Further information on installation and implementation will follow shortly ...
